## Introduction

I was browsing through Kaggle to find a dataset to practice my PowerBI skills and came across this Netflix Dataset. After studying it for a while, I was convinced I could create a beautiful Netflix themes dashboard while drawing enough insights from my Analysis.

## Skills/Concept Demonstrated
1.	Power Query
2.	Power BI

## Dataset

The data was gotten from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows).

## Cleaning and Analysis

The cleaning process was easy as the data looked complete with very few missing values. I pondered using SQL for my cleaning and manipulation but opted for Power Query as there was no much manipulation needed. I also needed to sharpen my Power Query skills as I had not used it in a while. I was able to extract the Weekday and Month from the ‘Date posted’ column and also edit some movie names that had the hashtag in front of them. Since missing values were not very prominent in the data, I removed the entries with missing values and then ensured all the data types were currently represented in the column headers. 

## Visualization

I was able to create the Netflix themed Dashboard with PowerBI.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

1. Netflix's Highest rated Genres are not its most produced. More international TV shows and Documentaries should be produced.

2. Africa has some of the shows with the highest IMBD score. Netflix should explore the continent more and produce more international TV shows.
